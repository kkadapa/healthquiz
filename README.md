# healthquiz
Python script that implements the health quiz

This script prompts the user to enter their email address and responses to the quiz questions, and then passes the input to the calculate_score function, which calculates the score and returns it as a floating point number. The score is calculated by assigning a point value to each answer as described in the previous response, and then dividing the total number of points by the total number of questions. The resulting score is then printed to the console.
